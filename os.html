      <center><h1>Operating System</h1></center><br><br>

      <h3><b>MainFrame System</b></h3>
      MainFrame are one of the large and powerfull computer systems. Mainframes consist of a large storage capacity. They are the first computers used to handle the high volume and complex processing needs of commercial sector, scientific applications and government agencies. In last few years mainframe has got grown from being a simple batch system to a multiprogramming system to time sharing system.
      <br>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Batch Systems </b><br>
          Batch processing was very popular in the 1970s. The jobs were executed in batches. People used to have a single computer known as a mainframe. Users using batch operating systems do not interact directly with the computer. Each user prepares their job using an offline device like a punch card and submitting it to the computer operator. Jobs with similar requirements are grouped and executed as a group to speed up processing. </li>
          <img src="img/batch.png" alt="" id="img1">
          <br>
         There were many disadvantages of batch operating System : <br><br>
            <ol type="i">
              <li><strong>Limited Interactivity:</strong> Batch systems lack real-time user interaction during job processing.</li>
              <li><strong>Turnaround Time:</strong> Jobs in batch systems may have longer turnaround times, causing delays.</li>
              <li><strong>Resource Utilization:</strong> Suboptimal use of resources may occur due to fixed resource allocations.</li>
              <li><strong>Difficulty in Debugging:</strong> Identifying and fixing errors can be challenging, especially if they occur late in the batch.</li>
              <li><strong>Job Prioritization:</strong> Lack of dynamic job prioritization may lead to inefficiencies in task execution.</li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
          <li><b>Multiprogramming System</b></li>
          A multiprogramming system is one where many programs (application or user programs ) reside in the main memory at the same time. These application or users programs not only share the main memory but also CPU time and other system resources. Earliar these resides only a single program in memory and that single program was not able to make efficient use of systen in multiprogramming was developed so as to improve the CPU utilisation and make effiecient use of system. IN multiprogramming system, the memory is divided into several small portions. One portion of the memory holds the operating system and other portions of the memory holds different programs.
          <br><br>
          <img src="img/multiprogramming.jpg" alt="" id="img1">
      </ol>
      <br>
      <b>Advantages of Multiprogramming are : </b>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>high CPU utilization</li>
        <li>increased throughout and efficient system use</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Disadvantages of multiprogramming are : </b>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>CPU Scheduling</li>
          <li>job scheduling</li>
          <li>Memory Management</li>
        </ol>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Time Sharing System</b></h3>
    Both batch system and multiprogramming system worked in non-interactive environment, means the user of the system has no direct interaction with the system when the program is being executed. So there was a need for interactive computing environment so that user of the computer system can provide input with the help input devices and can see the output on the computer monitor. Time sharing system is the enhancement of multiprogramming system to provide this interactive user environment. TIme sharing is also multitasking system. In time sharing system two or more users are allowed to share the system. The users interact withe the system through their seperate monitor terminals. The user programs are stored in computer memory. The operating system assigns time interval called time-slice to each programs stored in memory associated with different users. The operating system uses CPU scheduling (CPU scheduling is decision making how to assign CPU time efficiently to different user programs stored in memory for execution) to switch the CPU time among different user programs. 
    <br> <br>
    <h3><b>Real Time System</b></h3>
    Real Time Systems are the systems designed to work in environment where processing is to be done within bounded time constraint otherwise there are several consequences and even system failure. Real-time systems are used in real-time applications or in embedded systems. Some examples of real time applications are : fire control system, nuclear plants control system, air defence system, industrial control system, nuclear plants control system, flight control system, modern automobile containing an embedded systems etc. Since real time systems are used to handle real time applications so the proper functioing of real time system is based on time bounded processing as well as correct result.
